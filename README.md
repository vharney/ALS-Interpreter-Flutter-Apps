# ASL Interpreter Flutter Apps
This is the final version of the American Sign Language (ASL) Interpreter mobile application. This application integrates a TensorFlow CNN model which has been converted into a .tflite format into a Flutter application. This is a real-time image classification of the 26 alphabets of the ASL in addition to 3 other signs (delete, nothing and space).
